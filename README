Oz is a set of programs and classes to do automated installations of
operating systems.  It is useful for creating virtual machine disk
images containing an operating systems and, optionally, programs.

The best way to install it is to make an RPM out of it by running "make rpm"
or "make srpm", and then installing the resulting RPM on the target machine.
This will probably only work on Fedora or on RHEL 8 or later.

Once you have the RPM installed, you will need to build up TDL files to feed
as input into the building process.  Please see the examples directory to get
an idea of what a TDL file looks like.

Running the tests is also most easily done from a Fedora host. oz uses the
guestfs Python module, which is not available from pypi, and needs a running
libvirtd for most of the tests to run. Install all the test requirements:

dnf install python3-requests python3-m2crypto python3-libvirt python3-lxml python3-libguestfs python3-pytest python3-monotonic

If you wish to test on EL 7, make that:

yum install python-requests m2crypto libvirt-python python-lxml python-libguestfs pytest python-monotonic

then run the tests:

py.test tests/
